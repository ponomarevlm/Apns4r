This lib is intended to allow write my own APNs provider for Apple Push
Notificaion services (APNs) in ruby.  Requires json gem.

But if you want to use APNs sertificates with ruby (ie with OpenSSL),
here's a tip from great post about integration between Python and APNs:

"One caveat  - the Mac OS X Keychain Access application does not directly export
certificates and private keys in Private Enhanced Mail (.pem)  format, which is
what the OpenSSL implementation we use with Twisted will want, but luckily
there’s an easy mechanism to convert if you export the files as Personal
Information Exchange (.p12) format. The following two commands can be used to
convert the .p12 files into .pem files using the built-in openssl command on
Mac OS X or most Linux distributions:
openssl pkcs12 -in cred.p12 -out certkey.pem -nodes -clcerts
openssl pcks12 -in pkey.p12 -out pkey.pem -nodes -clcerts"

For code samples see sample.rb, also there is simple EventMachine powered
sendserver.rb
